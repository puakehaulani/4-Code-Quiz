## About the Project

**Code Quiz** is Homework 4 for UW Coding Bootcamp. We were given a [User Story](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-08-2020-u-c/tree/master/class-content/04-Web-APIs/02-Homework#user-story) and [Acceptance Criteria](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-08-2020-u-c/tree/master/class-content/04-Web-APIs/02-Homework#acceptance-criteria) to follow. We then had to build the quiz from the ground up.
